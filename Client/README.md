# minTAP Client

This folder contains the implementation of a minTAP client as a Chrome browser extension.

##  Installation

Please follow the Step 2 in this [Chrome help page](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2714278?hl=en) to install minTAP's browser extension.


**Note: the extension relies on IFTTT's developer portal to modify the rules to be minTAP-compatible. It appears that recently IFTTT's rule/applet creation UI is not working correctly. The workaround is to create a plain IFTTT rule first and then use the edit UI to make the rule minTAP-compatible.**
